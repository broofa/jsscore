        <h3>What is a JS-Score?</h3>

<p>A JS-Score is simple measure of Javascript performance.  <a href="http://jsscore.org">Find out your score</a>!</p>

<h3>How are JS-Scores calculated?</h3>

<p>JS-Scores are determined by finding <code>jsscore</code> such that ...</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0, n = Math.pow(10, jsscore); i &lt; n; i++) {}
</code></pre>

<p>... will take exactly 1-second to run.</p>

<p>In other words, a JS-Scores is the base-10 log of how quickly an empty for-loop runs, as measured in iterations/second.</p>

<p>Want some code?  Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/3056769">the reference jsscore() implementation</a></p>

<h3>What does a JS-Score <em>mean</em>?</h3>

<p>JS-Scores are measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale, meaning each full-point difference in score represents a 10X multiple in for-loop speed (while a half-point difference represents a ~3X multiple).</p>

<p>In absolute terms, if a device - say an iPhone4  running Safari 5.1 - has a JS-Score of 8, we know it's capable of doing ~100M iterations/second.  And if we further find that another device - perhaps a Macbook Pro running Chrome 20 - has a score of 9, we know it has 10X the performance (at least where empty for-loops are concerned).  Or, conversely, if we find IE6 running in a VMWare instance has a score of 7, we can say it has performs roughly 10% as well as the iPhone+Safari, or 1% as well as the Macbook+Chrome.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<h3>What's a JS-Score used for?</h3>

<p>It's hoped that JS-Scores can serve at least two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide a basis for device+browser performance when discussing 3rd-party benchmark data</li>
<li>Enable performance-based feature customization in web apps</li>
</ol><h3>"But empty for-loop performance isn't useful!"</h3>

<p>Yes... and no.  An empty for-loop is the simplest possible benchmark construct.  As such, it's trivial for interpreters to optimize (i.e. it's as good an indicator of raw hardware performance as we have in Javascript-land).  It is also trivially easy to implement, meaning it's possible to compute a JS-Score on <em>any</em> JS-enabled device.</p>
